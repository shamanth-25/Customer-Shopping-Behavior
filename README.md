📊 Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis & Visualization
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, starting from data loading and exploration to dashboard creation and reporting.
The objective is to extract meaningful insights from raw data using Python, SQL, and Power BI, and present the results in a clear and business-ready format.

The project covers:

Data loading and preprocessing using Python

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data cleaning and transformation

SQL-based analysis using PostgreSQL

Interactive dashboard development in Power BI

Report documentation and presentation using Gamma

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains structured data relevant for analytical insights.

It includes multiple features suitable for exploration, cleaning, and aggregation.

The dataset is first analyzed using Python and later stored in PostgreSQL for SQL-based querying.
